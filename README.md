Questions
---
- Question 1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

#####Answer
 Originally, I was going to regurgitate what I had mentioned in the phone screen interview.  About my final project at Lighthouse Labs.  And, with all the learning, tech-issues and leaving team members, it still impresses me that my small team got such a big application done in the two weeks.  

But instead, I want to mention the application I wrote for this interview and how proud I am of it.  Given the requirements and suggested time to finish, I strongly believe I went above and beyond.  I refreshed my memory on what it takes to build an application from scratch.  As well as had two all-nighters to finish that made me reminisce of the times I stayed at school till 2am writing an application.  I hope you enjoy it and appreciate the work put in.

- Question 2. Tell me about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why I should read it.

#####Answer
I don’t exactly have a specific article, but I would like to talk about something I’ve been following for awhile now.  Not because I enjoy it per-say, but because of the implications it may have with things I do enjoy.  I'm talking about EU’s infamous Article 13.

I'm sure you already know about this, but I'm going to give a brief summary just in case.  Article 13 is a proposal of new laws surrounding digital copyright. Where platform's are required to handle copyright issues and are liable to these issues.  This proposal was recently passed by the EU, making millions of people scared of what happens next.  It has the potential too drastically change of the internet we all love. YouTube, one of the most used apps on the planet will be affected drastically by this article. 

Anyways, if you care about it as much as I do, I ask of you to sign [this petition](https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet).  And if I have to give an article related, I’m going to refer you to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VHv0Nsajoc) by ColdFusion.

- Question 3. Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].

#####Answer
 I have written my solution for this in a gist which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/DorianKwan/4ea5dd0b1776cdb67ce4fc933960127b).

- Question 4. Create a simple web app, hosted at a URL we can visit.

Users are presented with a form for purchasing cryptocurrency
The form should allow the user to choose to buy either Bitcoin or Ethereum
Users can either enter a CAD amount, or a number of coins to buy, and click a buy button to perform the transaction
Transactions should be saved so that you can display a list of transactions the user has made, including the CAD price, the type of coin, and the number of coins purchased
You can fetch the current CAD ask price for Bitcoin using this API - https://api.quadrigacx.com/v2/ticker?book=btc_cad
And the current CAD ask price for Ethereum using this API - https://api.quadrigacx.com/v2/ticker?book=eth_cad
Please provide the source code via Github
