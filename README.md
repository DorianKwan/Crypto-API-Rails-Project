Preparation
---
This project was started for an application process to test and show my front-end and back-end development skills.  
Afterwards, I kept working on it to make it worthy of a personal project to be added to my portfolio.  

The basic functionality was to have an application where users could buy crypto online via a basic form input.  
The full spec list of the requirements:  
 - Users are presented with a form for purchasing cryptocurrency
 - The form should allow the user to choose to buy either Bitcoin or Ethereum
 - Users can either enter a CAD amount, or a number of coins to buy, and click a buy button to perform the transaction
 - Transactions should be saved so that you can display a list of transactions the user has made, including the CAD price, the type of coin and the number of coins purchased
 - You can fetch the current CAD ask price for Bitcoin using this API - https://api.quadrigacx.com/v2/ticker?book=btc_cad
 - And the current CAD ask price for Ethereum using this API - https://api.quadrigacx.com/v2/ticker?book=eth_cad
 - Please provide the source code via Github

 To start, I drew up some wireframes and planned a basic database schema.

Following the wireframes the best I could I started to write the application.
